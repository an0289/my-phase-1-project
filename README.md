# My Phase 1 Project - A Searchable Cocktail Recipe Website
1. Users should be able to use the search bar to search for cocktail recipes 
2. Users should be able to click on the recipe card and it opens to reveal the ingredients and preparation instructions
3. A randome recipe is rendered every time the webpage loads 
4. Users can use the dropdown menu to select a letter to have all cocktail recipes that start with that letter appear on the page
